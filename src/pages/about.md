I'm currently employed at Google.

Originally from Fontana, California, I've grown up in SoCal my entire life. I have many hobbies,
although I struggle to find enough time in the day for all of them. Some of them are:

- reading (primarily Sci-Fi, Fantasy, & Magical-realism)
- long-distance running
- linguistics & learning languages
- yoga
- guitar
- video games (top 3: Animal Crossing, Rhythm Heaven, Chrono Trigger)

and the list could go on...


## What's this site for?

This site is meant to serve as a portfolio on me for those who may be interested. But,
I'd also like it to serve as a place for all my random thoughts, reflections, and journals.
You may know it as a "[Digital Garden](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/)". 

## Final thoughts

This site will never be finished and isn't meant to be! If you have and thoughts or feedback,
please feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to start a chat.
